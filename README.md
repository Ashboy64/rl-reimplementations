# RL Reimplementations

This is a repository with simple re-implementations of common Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These reimplementations are built using Tensorflow and are applied to environments on the OpenAi Gym. 

Currently included are implementations of Q-learning, PPO, and Vanilla Policy Gradient. Implementations of DQN, CEM, and a few meta-learning methods are currently being worked on and will soon be added.
